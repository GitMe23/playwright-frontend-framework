## ðŸ”’ Environment Variables & Secrets

Environment variables are loaded using dotenv.
The test suite uses these variables to manage login credentials and other secrets securely.

âœ… Make sure to never commit real credentials in .env.demo.
Use .env locally and add it to .gitignore.


## ðŸ›  Page Object Model

Each page (e.g., LoginPage, HomePage) is modeled as a class under tests/pages/, exposing actions and locators to encourage reusable test steps and clean test files.

Example usage in tests:
```ts
const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
await loginPage.goto();
await loginPage.login(username, password);
```
